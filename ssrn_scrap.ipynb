      "enter string to predict : Machine learning is enabling a machine to learn from data without explicitly programming it with rules, because it can learn from the data it’s given. In essence, you could build an AI consisting of many different rules and it would also be able to be AI. But instead of programming all the rules, you feed the algorithm data and let the algorithm adjust itself to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Traditional science algorithms mainly process, whereas machine learning is about applying an algorithm to fit a model to the data. Examples of machine-learning algorithms that are used a lot and that you might be familiar with are decision trees, random forest, Bayesian networks, K-mean clustering, neural networks, regression, artificial neural networks, deep learning and reinforcement learning. Artificial neural networks and deep learning have recently become more common machine learning algorithms.\n",
